/** This import is here to guarantee that when you import the `sequelize` object
    all the models will be defined on it.

    In previous versions of Sequelize, the models were defined by importing it
    in the object using `Sequlize.import`. This is no longer the case, instead
    we first create the sequelize object and then import it in the relevant 
    `model.ts` file.

    TD:DR if you get "Model is not defined" errors, make sure you import the
    `sequelize` object from this file, not form `server/sequelize.ts`.
