It’s a medium for exchange of value, as another of your commenters has pointed out, but it’s also a way of keeping score. You’re rich, therefore you’re thriving in an environment and we should optimize towards doing things the way you’re doing them. You rightly point out that this is a view that leads to shallow optima and fragile systems, rather than the robus...",

Further, the idea of dominant currencies is reflected in the notion of a field of power—often the State in developed countries—that determines the rates of conversion between fields in terms of a single form of capital...",

Last I looked, there were still humans sitting in the cockpit of every plane I’ve flown on.  Similarly, I think we’ll find AI increasingly helping drivers.  However, to say “AI is...",
