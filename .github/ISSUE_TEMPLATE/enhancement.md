<!--
Enhancement requests are requests to make changes to an existing PubPub feature. If you'd like to suggest a new feature, please post in the ideas section of our discussion forum: https://github.com/pubpub/pubpub/discussions.

Before filing your enhancement, please search existing issues to make sure a similar one doesn't already exist. If one does, please leave a comment or reaction in support of the issue rather than creating a new one.

To fill out the request, please leave the below headers in tact, and fill out each section. If a section isn't applicable, leave it blank or write n/a under it. Please do not delete any template sections.
