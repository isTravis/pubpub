					<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
					<p>
						PubPub is a project of students and researchers in the Media Laboratory at
						Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). PubPub is a tool and service
						to write, publish, and read published work. PubPub is built to modernize
						many of the old traditions of academic publishing which have led to
						inefficiency, corruption, and the detriment of our pursuit of science.
					</p>
					<p>
						PubPub reserves the right to change the terms of the Terms of Service
						(&quot;TOS&quot;) or to modify its features at any time. The Site will post
						changes to the terms of this User Agreement at {locationData.hostname}
						/tos, and by accessing the Site after modifications to this User Agreement
						have been posted, you agree to be bound by all the modified terms.
					</p>
					<h1>Acceptance of Terms</h1>
					<p>
						By accessing content on the PubPub website (the “Site,” which includes all
						pages within the pubpub.org host directory and subdomains, all pages hosted
						on PubPub servers regardless of domain (including but not limited to Journal
						pages), and all associated services),
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							You accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this TOS; and
						</li>
						<li>
							You affirm that you are either 17 years of age or older or, if you are
							younger than 17, that your parent or legal guardian accepts these Terms
							of Service on your behalf.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						You must be (a) 17 years or over or (b) a parent or guardian must accept on
						your behalf these Terms of Service to access registration-only features on
						this Site. If we discover or have any reason to suspect that you have not
						met either of these conditions, then we reserve the right to suspend or
						terminate your registration to this Site immediately and without notice.
					</p>
					<h1>Use of the Site</h1>
					<p>
						For the purposes of this TOS, the term “Site Content” shall include all
						content, features, and functionality posted to the Site by PubPub as well as
						User-Generated Content.

						To the extent the Site incorporates the copyrighted material of
						third-parties (“Third-Party Content”), you represent, warrant, and agree
						that no Third-Party Content posted or otherwise shared by you on or through
						any of the Site, violates or infringes upon the rights of any third-party,
						including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, or other personal or
						proprietary rights, breaches or conflicts with any obligation, such as a
						confidentiality obligation, or contains libelous, defamatory, or otherwise
						unlawful material.
					</p>
					<p>
						MIT and PubPub do not warrant that any use of Third-Party Content will not
						infringe the rights of the content owners.

					<h1>User-Generated Content</h1>

						The Site includes features that support and publish User-Generated Content.
						The term “User-Generated Content,” for purposes of this TOS, means any
						copyrightable content that users submit to the Site. The Site may solicit
						and publish User-Generated Content through its blog, video postings, and
						chat features, among other forums. You shall not make use of these features:

							defects, date bombs, time bombs, malware, spyware, or other items of a
							destructive nature or any other malicious code or program;
						</li>
						<li>
							To knowingly carry out any action with the intent or effect of
							disrupting other users’ experience of the Site, such as intentionally
							causing a chat screen to scroll faster than other users are able to
							read, or deploying macros with large amounts of text for the purpose of
							disrupting the normal flow of user chats.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						By submitting User-Generated Content, you represent, warrant, and agree that
						no User-Generated Content posted or otherwise shared by you on or through
						any of the Site, violates or infringes upon the rights of any third-party,
						including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, or other personal or
						proprietary rights, breaches or conflicts with any obligation, such as a
						confidentiality obligation, or contains libelous, defamatory, or otherwise
						unlawful material.
					</p>
					<p>
						You hereby agree that User-Generated Content: (a) is hereby licensed under
						the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 License and may be used under
						the terms of that license or any later version of a Creative Commons
						Attribution License, or (b) is in the public domain (such as Content that is
						not copyrightable or Content you make available under CC0), or (c) if not
						owned by you, (i) is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
						License or (ii) is a media file that is available under any Creative Commons
						license or that you are authorized by law to post or share through any of
						the Services, such as under the fair use doctrine, and that is prominently
						marked as being subject to third-party copyright. All of Your Content must
						be appropriately marked with licensing and attribution information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon publishing, an archive of the content will perpetually be available to
						the public for reference.
					</p>
					<p>
						You acknowledge and accept that User-Generated Content posted to the Site
						may be made available for the public to access, view, and use, subject to
						the limited license set forth above (“Use of Site”).
					</p>
					<p>
						PubPub monitors User-Generated Content on the Site, and PubPub reserves the
						right to modify, edit, or remove any of said content at its discretion,
						without notice, and for any reason. PubPub may prescreen User-Generated
						Content and may decide, in its discretion, without notice, and for any
						reason, not to publish it. PubPub will not modify or edit any scholarly work
						that you submit for posting on the Site, but PubPub may decide, in its
						discretion, to withhold it from publication in its entirety. PubPub assumes
						no liability for monitoring, modifying, removing, or declining to publish
						User-Generated Content on this Service.
					</p>
					<p>
						You acknowledge and accept that the views and opinions expressed by other
						users on the Site are theirs alone and should not be ascribed to PubPub or
						to MIT. User-Generated Content and Third-Party Content are the sole
						responsibility of the users and third-parties, and their accuracy and
						completeness are not endorsed or guaranteed by PubPub or MIT.
					</p>
					<h1>Journals</h1>
					<p>
						PubPub allows registered users to create &quot;Journals&quot; that aggregate
						their own and other users&apos; Pubs under a single page. A Journal may
						reside on the PubPub domain or on a domain of the Journal
						administrator&apos;s choice. In either case, the content displayed in the
						Journal, including any Pubs, is displayed exclusively from a PubPub server.
						A Journal administrator does not need the approval of a Pub&apos;s author in
						order to include the Pub on his or her page. You may submit your Pub for
						inclusion in a Journal, but it is up to the Journal&apos;s administrator to
						decide whether to include it. PubPub displays in your profile a list of your
						Pubs and the Journals in which they appear. We may also send you a
						notification each time a Journal has elected to include your Pub, if you
						have opted in to receiving email from PubPub.
					</p>
					<h1>Prohibited Uses of the Site</h1>
					<p>
						You may not access or use the Site in any manner that could damage or
						overburden any MIT server, or any network connected to any MIT server. You
						may not use the Site in any manner that would interfere with any other
						party’s use of the Site.
					</p>
					<h1>Use of Names</h1>
					<p>
						You may not use MIT’s names, trademarks, logos, or insignia, or any version,
						abbreviation or representation of them, in any advertising, publicity,
						promotional materials or other public announcement without the prior written
						consent of MIT’s Technology Licensing Office, which consent MIT may withhold
						in its sole discretion.
					</p>
					<h1>Registration, Privacy, and Termination of Access</h1>
					<p>
						Certain areas of the Site may require registration or may otherwise ask you
						to provide information in order to participate. The decision to provide this
						information is optional; however if you elect not to provide such
						information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or
						functionalities. When you register, you must provide information to PubPub
						that is accurate, current and complete (excepting the use of a pseudonym).

					<p>
						You agree that MIT will not be liable to you for any loss or damages, either
						actual or consequential, arising out of or relating to these terms, or your

						own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
						subject to indemnification by you.
